        I got in trouble a lot at school, mostly for talking to people but one time sticks out to me in particular. I was probably in 4th or 5th grade and I walked into the bathroom to find a group of younger kids trying to stick a Pokémon card into the hand dryer. I didn't know why they were doing it and didn't really care, but my first thought was "I could probably do it" so I did it and went about my day, later on I got called to the principal's office because they told on me as soon as they were asked about it. I had to get it unstuck (which took just as little time as getting it stuck) and to this day it remains a great example of the "adversarial mindset". I'm going to go over this example and how the principles can be applied to hacking among other things. </div>
    <div class="subtitle">The Hand Dryer</div>
    <div class="content">
        The hand dryer was a simple enough device, a big box on the wall with a singular horizontal slit at the bottom. You put your hands under it and the air comes out and dries your hands. Most people will look at hand dryers and everything else and think "How do i use this?" they figure out how to use it as intended and go on about their day. This brings us to the first step of the adversarial mindset, instead of thinking about how to use it, you think about how to break it. When we think back to the design of the hand dryer it only has one opening we can think of this as an "attack vector". Now with more years of experience, I can actually think of another attack vector, the sensor, and this is how you have to think of anything that you're trying to exploit, you start with mapping out all the functionality and choose which ones can become attack vectors. In this scenario the younger kids had already given me what I refer to as a lead, a lead is anything that makes you go "Interesting!" when it happens, on a website this might look like a weird response from an endpoint or an unexpected output from a search box, anything that piques your interest. In my case, it was the fact that the Pokémon card could fit into the air hole, once you have a lead your goal becomes exploiting this unexpected behavior. On a website, this might look like fuzzing for different responses or even just messing around with the already interesting response to see how far you can take it. In this case, the limiting factor was how far the Pokémon card could go into the machine. The younger kids had failed because they were taking what could be seen as a brute force approach, trying to shove the card up as far as possible, but it wouldn't stay, so I had to come up with an approach to get the card stuck. This is when you carefully analyze your attack vector to notice things that the average user wouldn't think about, in my case I noticed that the opening was wider than the Pokémon card and the inside of the machine was even wider than the entry hole, meaning the easiest way to get the card stuck would be to make to card wider than the entry hole after it had been inserted.
