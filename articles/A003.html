        I got in trouble a lot a school, mostly for talking to people but one time sticks out to me in particular. I was probably in 4th or 5th grade and I walked into the bathroom to find a group of younger kids trying to stick a Pokémon card into the hand dryer. I didn't know why they were doing it and didn't really care, but my first thought was "I could probably do it" so I did it and went about my day, later on i got called to the principles office because they told on me as soon as they were asked about it. I had to get it unstuck (which took just as little time as getting it stuck) and to this day it remains a great example of the "adversarial mindset". I'm going to go over this example and how the principles can be applied to hacking among other things
