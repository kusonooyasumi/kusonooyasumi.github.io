        I got in trouble a lot at school, mostly for talking to people but one time sticks out to me in particular. I was probably in 4th or 5th grade and I walked into the bathroom to find a group of younger kids trying to stick a Pokémon card into the hand dryer. I didn't know why they were doing it and didn't really care, but my first thought was "I could probably do it" so I did it and went about my day, later on I got called to the principal's office because they told on me as soon as they were asked about it. I had to get it unstuck (which took just as little time as getting it stuck) and to this day it remains a great example of the "adversarial mindset". I'm going to go over this example and how the principles can be applied to hacking among other things. </div>

    <div class="content">
        The hand dryer was a simple enough device, a big box on the wall with a singular horizontal slit at the bottom. You put your hands under it and the air comes out and dries your hands. Most people will look at hand dryers and everything else and think "How do i use this?" they figure out how to use it as intended and go on about their day. This brings us to the first step of the adversarial mindset, instead of thinking about how to use it, you think about how to break it. When we think back to the design of the hand dryer it only has one opening we can think of this as an "attack vector". Now with more years of experience, I can actually think of another attack vector, the sensor, and this is how you have to think of anything that you're trying to exploit, you start with mapping out all the functionality and choose which ones can become attack vectors. In this scenario the younger kids had already given me what I refer to as a lead, a lead is anything that makes you go "Interesting!" when it happens, on a website this might look like a weird response from an endpoint or an unexpected output from a search box, anything that piques your interest. In my case, it was the fact that the Pokémon card could fit into the air hole, once you have a lead your goal becomes exploiting this unexpected behavior. On a website, this might look like fuzzing for different responses or even just messing around with the already interesting response to see how far you can take it. In this case, the limiting factor was how far the Pokémon card could go into the machine. The younger kids had failed because they were taking what could be seen as a brute force approach, trying to shove the card up as far as possible, but it wouldn't stay, so I had to come up with an approach to get the card stuck. This is when you carefully analyze your attack vector to notice things that the average user wouldn't think about, in my case I noticed that the opening was wider than the Pokémon card and the inside of the machine was even wider than the entry hole, meaning the easiest way to get the card stuck would be to make to card wider than the entry hole after it had been inserted.

        You may be able to tell where this is going already, but I'll continue to break it down just to be thorough. Next, we need to consider the properties of the Pokémon card, we've established that it's thin enough to fit into the entry but too long to be inserted all the way (teehee), it's also made of paper, so the shape can be changed. Now when we consider all of these factors our path becomes glaringly clear, we need to modify the shape of the Pokémon card to fit our needs. If you've ever folded cardboard you'll notice that after it's folded it will try to return to its original shape, meaning if we can compress the Pokémon card to fit inside the opening it should expand out, so if we can compress it enough to fit all the way past the entry the rest should take care of itself. So I folded the card up and stuck it in, and of course, because the card expands it gets stuck right past the entrance and becomes lodged there. 
        <br>
        Now the exploit has been thoroughly explained, but there are still a few more things that we can look at here, the main one being how I knew how small the card needed to be to fit all the way in. Well if you remember the card would stop at a certain point when it wasn't folded, this is a vital piece of information because it tells us exactly how big the entrance is. This is an example of the type of mindset that you should take when hacking, carefully analyze behaviors, figure out what they mean in the context of the target, and the more information you have the closer you will be to crafting an effective exploit.
